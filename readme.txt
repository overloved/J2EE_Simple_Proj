This is a simple login and logout J2EE application that is running on Apache Tomcat 6.0.48.


I created a database named “FannieMae”, and a table called “users” with a user. The database and table information are defined in the Constant.java class with final value.
Please change the username and password of local database before running this app.

The username is: admin
The password is: 1234

I wrote a sql file that contains all the sql queries.

The key point of implementing this app is:

To show ability of using J2EE technology, such as jsp, servlet, JDBC, JavaBean, DAO, and tomcat.
.xml file defines the way using servlet file to redirect the jsp pages.
